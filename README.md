# MSACAÔºöFake News Detection via Multi-scale Semantic Alignment and Cross-modal Attention
Pytorch code for the MSACA paper accepted in the The 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2024)

## Overview
This repository contains code necessary to run the MSACA. MSACA is a multimodal fake news detection network by deep learning. See our paper for details on the code.

## Dataset
The meta-data of the Weibo and GossipCop datasets used in our experiments are available in their papers.
- Multimodal Fusion with Recurrent Neural Networks for Rumor Detection on Microblogs [ËÆ∫ÊñáÂú∞ÂùÄ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3123266.3123454)
- Verifying Multimedia Use at MediaEval 2016 [È°πÁõÆÂú∞ÂùÄ](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/image-verification-corpus/tree/master/mediaeval2016)

## Running the code 
The `train.py` is the main file for running the code.
